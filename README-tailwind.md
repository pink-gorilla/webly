# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind css (https://tailwindcss.com) makes it really easy to build custom ui.

## Template sites

Publicly available templates are written in html. To convert them to hiccup,
you can use this converter:  http://html2hiccup.buttercloud.com/

Differences to html: 
- Reagent does not support style strings; it is necessary to convert style from
string to map.
- svg viewbox has to be :view-box
- html comments need to be commented out with ;
